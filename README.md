The PySAL **segregation** package is a tool for analyzing patterns of urban segregation.
With only a few lines of code, **segregation** users can

Calculate over 40 segregation measures from simple to state-of-the art, including:

- [single-group segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/10_singlegroup_indices.ipynb)
- [multi-group segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/02_multigroup_indices.ipynb)
- spatial segregation indices
  - [using spatial weights matrices, euclidian distances, or topological relationships](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/10_singlegroup_indices.ipynb)
  - [using multiscalar definitions](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/04_multiscalar_example.ipynb)
  - [Kullback-Leiber divergence index](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/kl_divergence_profile_walkthrough.ipynb)
- [local segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/03_local_indices.ipynb)

Test whether segregation estimates are statistically significant:

## Installation

Released versions of segregation are available on pip and anaconda

pip:

```bash
pip install segregation
```

[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge segregation
```

You can also install the current development version from this repository 

 download [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/):

`cd` into the directory and run the following commands

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate segregation
python setup.py develop
```

## Getting started

For a complete guide to the `segregation` API, see the online
[documentation](https://pysal.org/segregation/). 

For code walkthroughs and sample analyses, see the
[example notebooks](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/tree/master/notebooks)

## Calculating Segregation Measures

Each index in the **segregation** module is implemented as a class, which is built from a `pandas.DataFrame`
or a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`. To estimate a segregation statistic, a user needs to call the segregation class
she wishes to estimate, and pass three arguments:

- the DataFrame containing population data
- the name of the column with population counts for the group of interest
- the name of the column with the total population for each enumeration unit

Every class in **segregation** has a `statistic` and a `core_data` attributes.
The first is a direct access to the point estimation of the specific segregation measure
and the second attribute gives access to the main data that the module uses internally to
perform the estimates.

### Single group measures

If, for example, a user was studying income segregation and wanted to know whether
high-income residents tend to be more segregated from others.
This user may want would want to fit a dissimilarity index (D) to a DataFrame called `df` to
a specific group with columns like `"hi_income"`, `"med_income"` and `"low_income"` that store counts of people in each income
bracket, and a total column called `"total_population"`. A typical call would be something like this:

```python
from segregation.singlegroup import Dissim
d_index = Dissim(df, "hi_income", "total_population")
```

To see the estimated D in the first generic example above, the user would have just to run
`d_index.statistic` to see the fitted value.

If a user would want to fit a *spatial* dissimilarity index (SD), the call would be nearly
identical, save for the fact that the `DataFrame` now needs to be a `GeoDataFrame` with an appropriate `geometry` column

```python
from segregation.singlegroup import SpatialDissim
spatial_index = SpatialDissim(gdf, "hi_income", "total_population")
```

Some spatial indices can also accept either a [PySAL](http://pysal.org) `W` object, or a [pandana](https://github.com/UDST/pandana) `Network` object,
which allows the user full control over how to parameterize spatial effects.
The network functions can be particularly useful for teasing out differences in
segregation measures caused by two cities that have two very different spatial structures,
like for example Detroit MI (left) and Monroe LA (right):

### Multigroup measures

**segregation** also facilitates the estimation of multigroup segregation measures.

In this case, the call is nearly identical to the single-group, only now we pass a list of
column names rather than a single string;
reprising the income segregation example above, an example call might look like this  

```python
from segregation.multigroup import MultiDissim
index = MultiDissim(df, ['hi_income', 'med_income', 'low_income'])
```

```python
index.statistic
```

Available multi-group indices are summarized in the table below:

| **Measure**                                 | **Class/Function**               | **Spatial?** | **Specific Arguments** |
|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:------------:|:----------------------:|
| Multigroup Dissimilarity                    | MultiDissim                      |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Gini                             | MultiGiniSeg                     |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Normalized Exposure              | MultiNormalizedExposure          |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Information Theory               | MultiInformationTheory           |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Relative Diversity               | MultiRelativeDiversity           |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Squared Coefficient of Variation | MultiSquaredCoefficientVariation |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Diversity                        | MultiDiversity                   |      No      |       normalized       |
| Simpson’s Concentration                     | SimpsonsConcentration            |      No      |           -            |
| Simpson’s Interaction                       | SimpsonsInteraction              |      No      |           -            |
| Multigroup Divergence                       | MultiDivergence                  |      No      |           -            |

### Local measures

Also, it is possible to calculate local measures of segregation.
A `statistics` attribute will contain the values of these indexes. **Note:
in this case the attribute is in the plural since, many statistics are fitted, one for
each enumeration unit** Local segregation indices have the same signature as their global
cousins and are summarized in the table below:

| **Measure**                   | **Class/Function**             | **Spatial?** | **Specific Arguments** |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:------------:|:----------------------:|
| Location Quotient             | MultiLocationQuotient          |      No      |           -            |
| Local Diversity               | MultiLocalDiversity            |      No      |           -            |
| Local Entropy                 | MultiLocalEntropy              |      No      |           -            |
| Local Simpson’s Concentration | MultiLocalSimpsonConcentration |      No      |           -            |
| Local Simpson’s Interaction   | MultiLocalSimpsonInteraction   |      No      |           -            |
| Local Centralization          | LocalRelativeCentralization    |     Yes      |           -            |

## Testing for Statistical Significance

Once the segregation indexes are fitted, the user can perform inference to shed light for
statistical significance in regional analysis.
The summary of the inference framework is presented in the table below:

| **Inference Type** | **Class/Function** |                    **Function main Inputs**                    |       **Function Outputs**       |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Single Value       | SingleValueTest    |  seg_class, iterations_under_null, null_approach, two_tailed   |   p_value, est_sim, statistic    |
| Two Values         | TwoValueTest       | seg_class_1, seg_class_2, iterations_under_null, null_approach | p_value, est_sim, est_point_diff |

### [Single Value Inference](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/inference_wrappers_example.ipynb)

![](doc/_static/images/singleval_inference.png)

### [Two-Value Inference](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/inference_wrappers_example.ipynb)

![](doc/_static/images/twoval_inference.png)

### [Decomposition](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/decomposition_wrapper_example.ipynb)

Another useful analysis that can be performed with the **segregation** module is a
decompositional approach where two different indexes can be broken down into their spatial
component (`c_s`) and attribute component (`c_a`). This framework is summarized in the table
below:

| **Framework** | **Class/Function**   |        **Function main Inputs**         | **Function Outputs** |
|:--------------|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Decomposition | DecomposeSegregation | index1, index2, counterfactual_approach |       c_a, c_s       |

![](doc/_static/images/decomp_example.png)

In this case, the difference in measured D statistics between Detroit and Monroe is
attributable primarily to their demographic makeup, rather than the spatial structure of
the two cities.
(Note, this is to be expected since *D* is not a spatial index)
