@article{debezenac2021,
abstract = {The paper provides numerical measures and visualizations of urban segregation based on a new index, the Distortion coefficient. Distortion coefficients are derived from trajectories of contact with the city's population as an individual will encounter an increasing number of persons in a growing distance from their original location. They can be interpreted as measures of how different, or in technical terms, how distorted the view of the city is from any one location. In this paper, we present the theoretical rationale and the procedure leading to the computation of the Distortion coefficients. Through a detailed illustration using Chicago as a case study, we provide the general framework for analyzing and visualizing Distortion. We show that these measures are able to capture complex demographic changes over time and paint a more complete picture of segregation than indices based on imposed scales.},
